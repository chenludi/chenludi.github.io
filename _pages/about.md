I am looking for a postdoc job (starting from Jan/Feb 2026) now!

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, where I am working with Kirk Lohmueller ([Lohmueller Lab](https://lohmueller.eeb.ucla.edu/people/)). My research integrates population genetics, empirical human genomics, and biomedical applications.

My research investigates how natural selection shapes human health and disease. I combine evolutionary theory, model-based, statistical and machine-learning computational methods, and genomic, protein structure, transcription and epigenomic data to answer two questions: 1) how natural selection affects human infectious diseases, particularly on how humans adapt to viruses 2) how natural selection affects human chronic diseases. Particularly on natural selection on various non-coding genomic regions and its impact on chronic diseases. 

In my previous work, I demonstrated that protein stability is a key mechanism of viral adaptation in human proteins (preprint at bioRxiv, under review at Molecular Biology and Evolution). I estimated the distribution of fitness effects of putatively functional noncoding mutations in human genomes, revealing that top conserved genomic regions only include a small proportion of deleterious mutations (preprint at bioRxiv). I also discovered that Mendelian disease genes show slower recent adaptation, highlighting how a lag in evolutionary response to environmental change may underlie human genetic disease (published in eLife, old model).

Previously, I earned my PhD in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona ([thesis](http://chenludi.github.io/files/2023_ChenluDi_phdthesis.pdf)), advised by David Enard ([Enard Lab](https://enardlab.com/)) and obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from Zhejiang University, China, in 2016. 

Please feel free to contact me at chenludi6[at]gmail[dot]com for any professional correspondence.
