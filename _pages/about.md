I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with [Evan Eichler](https://eichler.gs.washington.edu/).

I investigate how natural selection shapes human health and disease. 

**1)** How does natural selection act on diverse noncoding genomic regions and complex mutations, and how do these processes influence chronic disease risk? 

**2)** How did humans adapt to viruses? I combine evolutionary theory, model-based statistical and machine-learning computational approaches, and multi-omic data, including genomes, protein structures, transcription, and epigenomics, to answer these two questions.

In my previous work, 

I estimated the distribution of fitness effects of putatively functional noncoding mutations in the human genome and found that the most highly conserved regions account for only a small fraction of deleterious mutations, suggesting that selective pressures have shifted over time ([preprint](http://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.14.654124) at bioRxiv). 

I also discovered that Mendelian disease genes exhibit reduced recent adaptation, highlighting that delayed evolutionary responses to environmental change may contribute to human genetic disease (published in [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/69026), old model). 

I demonstrated that protein stability is a key mechanism of viral adaptation in human proteins ([preprint](http://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.01.518739)). 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher with Kirk Lohmueller ([Lohmueller Lab](https://lohmueller.eeb.ucla.edu/people/)) at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Los Angeles. 

I earned my PhD in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona ([thesis](http://chenludi.github.io/files/2023_ChenluDi_phdthesis.pdf)), advised by David Enard ([Enard Lab](https://enardlab.com/)), and obtained my bachelor’s degree from Zhejiang University, China, in 2016.
