I am looking for a postdoc job (starting from Jan/Feb 2026) now!

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, where I am working with Kirk Lohmueller ([Lohmueller Lab](https://lohmueller.eeb.ucla.edu/people/)). My research integrates population genetics, empirical human genomics, and biomedical applications.

My overall research goal is to understand how species survive in changing environments by studying their genetic and epigenetic variation. I combine evolutionary theory, population genetics model-based and machine-learning methods, and genomic data to answer the question of how natural selection affects human health. 

My research consists of two areas. 
First, I investigate how **humans evolve against viruses**. Using protein structures, functional genomics, and gene regulatory networks, I explore how **human proteins** and **regulatory elements** evolve in response to viruses. 
Second, I aim to understand how natural selection connects to non-infectious diseases by focusing on **natural selection** in Mendelian diseases and the **evolution of non-coding genomic regions**, which harbor the majority of variants associated with complex diseases. 

Previously, I earned my PhD in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona ([thesis](http://chenludi.github.io/files/2023_ChenluDi_phdthesis.pdf)), advised by David Enard ([Enard Lab](https://enardlab.com/)) and obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from Zhejiang University, China, in 2016. 

Please feel free to contact me at chenludi6[at]gmail[dot]com for any professional correspondence.
